### NBA Vol. II

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of various predictive models on a given dataset. This project have a bunch of csv files already preprocessed in [NBA Vol. I](https://github.com/cremerf/NBAVol_I) to use as input datasets. The project uses Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model development.

This project utilizes [scikit-learn 1.2.2](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) a widely used and popular Python library, as the core framework for implementing various machine learning models and algorithms.


##### Goals

The goals of this project are:

1) Define a prediction task
2) Select evaluation metrics and baseline models
3) Perform feature engineering and standardization
4) Train and use predictive models: Univariable and Multivariate Linear Regression, Classification
5) Understand how Gradient Descent works by implementing a Linear Regressor in Python
